Class Presentations
-------------------

Four students each week form a panel to review the issues covered by the class the previous week. These may include further research, dramatizations of ethical dilemmas, and reformulation of social and ethical issues such as equity and access to health care, and particularly the imperatives, challenges, and rewards of doing innovative research and clinical care in resource-poor settings around the world.

Final Written Paper
-------------------

HST students are asked to write short papers on topics covered in class, on lab or scientific research experience abroad, or on solutions to medical issues in resource-poor settings. Graduate students write longer, more complete papers in consultation with MIT course faculty.
